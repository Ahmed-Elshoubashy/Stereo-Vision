# Stereo-Vision
In this part we implemented and tested some simple stereo algorithms.
In each case we take two images(a left and a right image) and compute the
horizontal disparity (ie., shift) of pixels along each scanline. This is the so-called baseline stereo
case, where the images are taken with a forward-facing camera, and the translation between
cameras is along the horizontal axis.
we used Block matching and dynamic programming techniques.
